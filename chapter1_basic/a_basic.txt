// NODE JS - OpenSource, Cross-platform I/O,  JS runtime

>> NodeJs uses CommonJS module with module.exports and Vanilla JS uses ES6 module
>> NodeJs runs it's code outside the browser but how? because NodeJs creates the environment to run JS outside the browser
>> If you wanted to use JS outside the browser then NodeJs is the way to do it

// IMPORT (ES Module) vs NODEJS (Common JS module)
>> Basically Node Js supports CommonJs and Es Module but CommonJs is wildly used and recommended approach
>> We can still use ES module way using WORKAROUND => (type:'module' --> in Package.json (or) save file as .mjs)

// DON'T using NodeJs
>> We can't use both module.exports and exports at the same time. Should use any 1 syntax only at a time
>> If using Es Module then require will not be used - here we'll give actual fileName with extension while ES import
